<h1 align="center"> Push_swap | 42 School Project </h1>
<h4>This project involves sorting data on a stack, with a limited set of instructions, and the smallest number of moves.</h4>
<p>To make this happen, I had to manipulate various sorting algorithms and choose the most appropriate solution for optimized data sorting</p>
<p>This project was a highly straightforward algorithm project: data must be sorted.<br>
I had at my disposal a set of integer values, 2 stacks, and a set of instructions to manipulate both stacks. The goal was to write a program in C called 
push_swap which calculates and displays on the standard output the smallest program, made of Push swap language instructions, that sorts the integers 
received as arguments.</p>

<h4>Guide</h4>

<p>We are given two stacks called Stack A and Stack B. Stack A is given a random list of unorganized numbers. We must take the random list of 
numbers in Stack A and sort them so that Stack A is organized from smallest to largest. There are only a few moves weâ€™re allowed to used to 
manipulate the stacks. The main goal of this project is to organize Stack A in as few moves as possible.</p>
